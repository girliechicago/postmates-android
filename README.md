Postmates Android API Wrapper

The files you need(besides MainActivity and TestCallback) are in: postmates-android/app/src/main/java/com/example/chs/postmates_android/

Please download and set up OkHttp by Square in order to use the API wrapper.

Thank you!

I made this API wrapper as part of our Cal Hacks 2015 project. 
We won the Postmates $1000 prize for it!
